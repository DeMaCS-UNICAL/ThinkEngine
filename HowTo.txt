Assume you are working on a Unity project stored in the *UnityGameProject* folder.

- Extract the ThinkEnginePlugin.rar in the root folder of you Unity project (the one containing the Assets folder).
- Make sure that dlv2.exe in the "lib" folder has executability access rights.

From now on you can use ThinkEngine for adding AI capabilities to your gameobject.

- The Sensor/Actuator configurator can be added as a (script) component to a GameObject (or Prefab) to configure
- Add a script component to a GO (or Prefab) choosing as script the "Brain" 

N.B. Prefabs should be located in "Assets/Resources/Prefabs". 
If you want to check the ASP facts files, check the box "Maintain facts file" in the Brain component and look for the folder "ThinkEngineFacts" in you "Temp" system folder.
