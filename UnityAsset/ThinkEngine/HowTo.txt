Assume you are working on a Unity project stored in the *UnityGameProject* folder.

-Open EmbASP4Unity.sln with Visual Studio and compile the solution. You should get new binary files in the ./bin folder

- Copy the EmbASP4Unity.dll file from bin\Debug to *UnityGameProject*\Assets\Plugins  [create the folder if not existing]
- Copy the Newtonsoft.Json.dll file from bin\Debug to *UnityGameProject*\Assets\Plugins
- Copy the dlv.exe binary from bin\Debug to *UnityGameProject*\lib
- Make sure that dlv.exe has executability access rights.

From now on you can use ThinkEngine for adding AI capabilities to your gameobject.

- The Sensor/Actuator configurator can be added as a (script) component to a GameObject to configure
- Add a script component to a GO choosing as script the "Brain" (you can find it after choosing EmbASP4Unity.it.unical.mat.objectMapper)
