# ThinkEngine

**ThinkEngine** is a [Unity](https://unity.com/) asset that allows to integrate automated reasoning modules in a videogame or whatever other kind of software developed in Unity. 

ThinkEngine has been developed having the integration of declarative [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) modules in mind, but other types of automated reasoning can be wired (e.g., PDDL), with an effort which we are constantly working at making as light as possible. 

More information, installation instructions and downloads are available from our [wiki page](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/ThinkEngine/wiki).
