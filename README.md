# ThinkEngine
**ThinkEngine** is a [Unity](https://unity.com/) asset that provides an easy integration of an [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) solver in a videogame or whatever other kind of software developed in Unity. 

ThinkEngineâ€™s goal is to make transparent the integration of a declarative formalism within the videogame lifecycle from the point of view of a game developer. ThinkEngine provides smooth ways for easily dealing with data mapping issues, threads synchronization and reasoning event triggering. 

The asset is released as a bunch of .dll files collecting a number of C# scripts. We currently support only Windows videogames.

More information, installation instructions and downloads are available from our [wiki page](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/ThinkEngine/wiki).
