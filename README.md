# ThinkEngine

**ThinkEngine** is a [Unity](https://unity.com/) asset that allows to integrate automated reasoning modules in a videogame or whatever other kind of software developed in Unity. 

ThinkEngine has been developed having the integration of declarative [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) modules in mind, but other types of automated reasoning can be wired (e.g., PDDL), with an effort which we are constantly working at making as light as possible.
